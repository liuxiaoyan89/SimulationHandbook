# SimulationHandbook
This is a handbook for Simulation (a postgraduate course at Beijing Normal University) led by Professor Saini Yang.

We aim to help you: (1) start your code journey, if you are a novice in programming; (2) learn some basic skills in programming, specifically with Python 3; (3) finish the programming homework, and complete your future tasks if possible.

Hope you enjoy and love programming from our course! If you need more learning resources, please feel free to contact me :)
